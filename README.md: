# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This project aims to build and evaluate deep learning models for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes represent airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.
